//This script is best used in conjunction with a script launcher like "Launch Pad" or "ft-Toolbar." Mocha AE
//can be annoying to launch. It install with after effects but can only be launched with the "Track with Mocha AE"
//command in the animation window. Meaning, to get mocha open, a layer needs to be selected. This is fine 
//when going to track a layer, but if you want to open an earlier mocha save file, having this be the only way to get
//the application open is cumbersome, especially since it can't even be opened by double click on the save files.
//This script binds the launching of mocha to a single button press (when used with a launcher.)

    //a little hack to bring the tempComp to the front thanks to @rich helvey
